##  Responsive Design Behaviour  

The layout is fully responsive and dynamically adjusts:

| **Tablet (768–1024px)** | Balanced grid layout, images aligned to center, smaller text scaling. |
| **Desktop (>1024px)** | Full-width sections, multiple columns for projects and about content, large hero banner with name and role. |

Uses **CSS Flexbox and Grid** to ensure components always align correctly regardless of screen size.
